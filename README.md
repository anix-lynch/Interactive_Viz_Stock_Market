## 🌐 Project Overview

The stock market is constantly fluctuating, driven by various factors that make it challenging to predict future movements. In this project, we’ll leverage Python’s data analysis and visualization libraries to analyze historical stock market data from the NIFTY-50 (2008–2021) dataset. We’ll focus on one specific stock file to perform in-depth data analysis, applying functions to the data and visualizing it using **Plotly** and **Matplotlib**.
